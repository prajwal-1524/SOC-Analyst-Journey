Security Controls and SOC Fundamentals (CySA+ Notes)

1. Cybersecurity Roles and Responsibilities

Cybersecurity operations involve multiple roles to protect systems and respond to security incidents.

Key Roles:
• Security Analyst: Monitors security alerts, analyzes logs, and investigates suspicious activity.  
• SOC Analyst: Works in the SOC to triage alerts, perform investigations, and escalate incidents.  
• Incident Responder: Contains and eradicates threats, recovers systems, and documents incidents.  
• Threat Hunter: Proactively searches for hidden threats using advanced analysis techniques.  
• Security Engineer: Designs and implements security tools, infrastructure, and automation.  
• Security Administrator: Manages security configurations, user access, and policies.  
• CISO: Responsible for organizational security strategy, governance, and risk management.  




2. Security Operations Center (SOC)

A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a centralized team responsible for monitoring, detecting, investigating, and responding to cybersecurity threats.

Core SOC Functions:
• Monitoring: Collects logs from endpoints, networks, servers, and applications using SIEM tools.  
• Detection: Identifies suspicious behavior and known attack patterns using IDS/IPS and threat intelligence.  
• Analysis: Validates alerts and determines the scope and impact of incidents.  
• Response: Isolates infected systems, blocks malicious traffic, and resets compromised accounts.  
• Reporting: Documents incidents and provides security recommendations and metrics.  

Common SOC Tools:
• SIEM platforms (Splunk, ELK, Microsoft Sentinel)  
• EDR/XDR solutions  
• IDS/IPS systems  
• SOAR platforms  



3. Security Control Categories

Security controls are safeguards used to reduce cybersecurity risks.

Administrative Controls:
• Security policies and procedures  
• Employee security awareness training  
• Incident response and disaster recovery plans  

Technical Controls:
• Firewalls and intrusion detection systems  
• Antivirus and endpoint protection  
• Encryption and access control mechanisms  

Physical Controls:
• Locks, guards, and CCTV systems  
• Biometric authentication  
• Secure data center facilities  



4. Selecting Security Controls

Security controls should be selected based on risk and business requirements.

Key Considerations:
• Risk Assessment: Identify threats, vulnerabilities, and potential impact.  
• Defense-in-Depth: Implement multiple layers of security to reduce single points of failure.  
• Cost vs Benefit: Balance security effectiveness with operational cost and usability.  
• Framework Alignment: Follow industry frameworks such as NIST CSF, ISO/IEC 27001, and CIS Controls.  



SOC Relevance

Security controls support SOC operations by:
• Preventive controls reducing attack surface  
• Detective controls generating alerts for monitoring  
• Corrective controls enabling recovery after incidents  

Understanding these concepts is essential for SOC analysts to detect, analyze, and respond to cyber threats.



Real-World Example

Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for VPN access is a technical preventive control that reduces credential-based attacks such as phishing and brute-force attempts.
